### Hey, I'm Michael J. Williams 👋

I'm a Research Fellow at the [Insitute of Cosmology and Gravitation, University of Portsmouth](https://www.port.ac.uk/research/research-groups-and-centres/institute-of-cosmology-and-gravitation) where I work on applications of machine learing to gravitational-wave data analysis.
